Python File Operations Assignment

This assignment demonstrates basic file handling in Python using three scripts: writing, reading, and error handling.

üìÇ Files Included

Write.py

Demonstrates how to create and write text into a file.

Example: writing multiple lines into a file named schedule_2025.pdf.

Read.py

Demonstrates how to read the contents of a file.

Example: reading line by line.

Error_Handling_Lab.py

Demonstrates error handling in file operations.

Example: catching FileNotFoundError when a file doesn‚Äôt exist.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

Run each script with Python:

python Write.py
python Read.py
python Error_Handling_Lab.py

‚ö° Example Behavior

Write.py ‚Üí creates/writes to a file with sample text.

Read.py ‚Üí opens the file and prints its content.

Error_Handling_Lab.py ‚Üí shows safe file handling with error messages if the file is missing.

‚úÖ Learning Outcomes

By completing this lab, you will learn:

How to open, read, write, and close files.

How to use with open(...) for safer file operations.

How to use try-except-finally for error handling.
